    <p class="para1"><span class="head1">6. Printing Message on Console</span><br><br>To print a message in console,
        open your javascript file and type a function "console.log()" and type the value inside the parenthesis to print
        it. If it is a string value, then put a double quotation and then write the value. If it is a integer value,
        then just write the number inside the round brackets. If it is a float number, then also apply the same method
        like for integers. If you want to print a variable then declare a variable first and then declare a value inside
        it and then to print the value inside the varible, just write the name of the variable and the value inside it
        will be printed in the console.
